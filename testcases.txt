I. Chunk


Test Website:

Note: Chunk cache also works. It’s just that we cannot find a chunk website with a cacheable tag.

-Revalidation:
Test Website:
http://run.mocky.io/v3/478fdd46-81a4-4b41-83a2-a30d2e87622f
Note: Since it is hard to test cache re-validation, and we want to ensure our users can get the requested content, so we updated our re-validation logic. If we received a 304 response (meaning we can use the cached content), we will serve the cached content. If we did not receive a 304 response, we will send a request using the request URL. In that case, we can make sure our user always gets the correct and up-to-date content.
